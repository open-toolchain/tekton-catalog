# Container-Registry related tasks

- **containerize-task**: this task builds and pushes an image to the [IBM Cloud Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Registry?topic=registry-getting-started). This task relies on [Buildkit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit) to perform the build of the image.
- **cr-build-task**: this task builds and pushes an image to the [IBM Cloud Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Registry?topic=registry-getting-started). This task relies on [IBM Cloud Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Registry?topic=registry-getting-started) `build` command to perform the build of the image.
- **execute-in-dind-task**: this task runs `docker` commands (build, inspect...) against a Docker engine running as a sidecar container, and pushes the resulting image to the [IBM Cloud Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Registry?topic=registry-getting-started).
- **execute-in-dind-cluster-task**: this task runs `docker` commands (build, inspect...) against a Docker engine running in a Kubernetes cluster (a Docker DinD instance will be deployed if none is available on the build cluster), and pushes the resulting image to the [IBM Cloud Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Registry?topic=registry-getting-started).
- **vulnerability-advisor-task**: this task verifies that a [Vulnerability Advisor scan](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Registry?topic=va-va_index) has been made for the image and processes the outcome of the scan.

**WARNING: These tasks needs to run on Kubernetes cluster with minimal version 1.16. If you are using your own Delivery Pipeline Private Worker to run your tekton pipeline(s), ensure your cluster is updated to this version at least.**

## Install the Tasks
- Add a github integration to your toolchain with the repository containing the tasks (https://github.com/open-toolchain/tekton-catalog)
- Add this github integration to the Definitions tab of your Continuous Delivery tekton pipeline, with the Path set to `container-registry`
