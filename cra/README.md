# Code Risk Analyzer

Tasks to scan your codebase using the Code Risk Analyzer scanners

## Tasks

- **[cra-discovery](#cra-discovery)**: This task accesses various source artifacts from the repository and performs deep discovery to identify all dependencies (including transitive dependencies).
- **[cra-bom](#cra-bom)**: This task creates a Bill-of-Material (BoM) for a given repository that captures pedigree of all the dependencies and it is collected at different granularities.
- **[cra-cis-check](#cra-cis-check)**: This tasks runs configuration checks on kubernetes deployment manifests.
- **[cra-vulnerability-remediation](#cra-vulnerability-remediation)**: This task creates comments on Pull Requests and opens issues regarding bill of material and discovered vunerabilities.
- **[cra-comm-editor](#cra-comm-editor)**: This task creates comments on Pull Requests and opens issues regarding bill of material and discovered vunerabilities.
- **[cra-terraform-scan](#cra-terraform-scan)**: This task scans ibm-terraform-provider files for compliance issues.

## Install the Tasks
- Add a github integration to your toolchain with the repository containing the tasks (https://github.com/open-toolchain/tekton-catalog)
- Add this github integration to the Definitions tab of your Continuous Delivery tekton pipeline, with the Path set to `cra`

## Usages

- The `sample` sub-directory contains a listener to configure on Pull Request (or Merge Request for Gitlab/GRIT) EventListener definition that you can include in your tekton pipeline configuration to run an example usage of the CRA tasks.

  See the documentation [here](./sample/README.md)

- The `sample-cra-ci` sub-directory contains a listener to configure on commit pushed EventListener definition that you can include in your tekton pipeline configuration to run an example usage of the CRA tasks.

  See the documentation [here](./sample-cra-ci/README.md)


## cra-discovery

This task accesses various source artifacts from the repository and performs deep discovery
to identify all dependencies (including transitive dependencies). Specifically, it parses the following assets:

1. Dockerfile: All Build stages, Base Images in every stage, list of packages from base images,
any add-on packages installed on top of base image(s).

2. Package Manifests: requirements.txt (python), package-lock.json (Node.js), pom.xml (java)


### Inputs

#### Parameters

  - **repository**: The full URL path to the repo with the deployment files to be scanned
  - **revision**: (Default: `master`) The branch to scan
  - **commit-id**: The commit id of the change
  - **commit-timestamp**: (optional) The commit timestamp
  - **directory-name**:  The directory name where the repository is cloned
  - **pipeline-debug**: (Default: `0`) 1 = enable debug, 0 no debug
  - **continuous-delivery-context-secret**: (Default: `secure-properties`) Reference name for the secret resource
  - **ibmcloud-apikey-secret-key**: (Default: `apikey`) field in the secret that contains the api key used to login to ibmcloud
  - **maven-exclude-scopes**: (Default: `""`) Specifies which scopes to exclude dependencies in scanning. Example: `test,compile`
  - **gradle-exclude-configs**: (Default: `""`) Specifies which gradle configurations to exclude dependencies in scanning. Example: `runtimeClasspath,testCompileClasspath`
  - **nodejs-create-package-lock**: (Default: `false`) Enable CRA discovery to build the package-lock.json file for node.js repos
  - **python-create-requirements-txt**: (Default: `false`) Enable CRA discovery to build the requirements.txt file for python repos 

### Workspaces

- **artifacts**: The output volume to check out and store task scripts & data between tasks

#### Implicit / data from the pipeline

**Base image pulls secrets (optional)**

To provide pull credentials for the base image you use in your Dockerfile, for example for a UBI image from Red Hat registry, add these variables to your pipeline on he pipeline UI. The Task will look for them and if they are present, it will add an entry to the proper `config.json` for docker.

- **build-baseimage-auth-user** The username to the registry (Type: `text`)
- **build-baseimage-auth-password** The password to the registry (Type: `SECRET`)
- **build-baseimage-auth-host** The registry host name (Type: `text`)
- **build-baseimage-auth-email** An email address to the registry account (Type: `text`)

### Results

- **status**: Status of cra discovery task, possible value are - success|failure

## cra-bom
Bill-of-Material (BoM) for a given repository captures pedigree of all the dependencies and it is collected at different granularities. For instance, it captures list of base images used in the build, list of packages from the base images, list of application packages installed over base image. The BoM essentially acts as a ground truth for our analytic results and can potentially be used to enforce policy gates.

## cra-cis-check
Runs configuration checks on kubernetes deployment manifests.

Docker CIS provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure configuration posture for Docker container.
Code Risk Analyzer takes these security configurations as point of reference and identifies security controls that can be
checked in the deployment artifacts (*.yaml) for kubernetes applications.
In addition, this task also provided security `risk` for every control failure.

We identified following controls from CIS Docker 1.13.0 that we can implement in DevSecOps. Some additional controls are added based on open source references of [KCCSS](https://github.com/octarinesec/kccss)



|ID | Rule | Risk |
|---------|---------|:----------:|
|5.3|Ensure containers do not have CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability|High|
|5.3|Ensure containers do not have CAP_NET_RAW capability|High|
|5.4|Ensure privileged containers are not used|High|
|5.5|Ensure sensitive host system directories are not mounted on containers|Medium|
|5.7|Ensure privileged ports are not mapped within containers|Low|
|5.9|Ensure the host's network namespace is not shared|Medium|
|5.10|Ensure memory usage for container is limited|Medium|
|5.11|Ensure CPU priority is set appropriately on the container|Medium|
|5.12|Ensure the container's root filesystem is mounted as read only|Medium|
|5.15|Ensure the host's process namespace is not shared|Medium|
|5.16|Ensure the host's IPC namespace is not shared|Medium|
|5.31|Ensure the Docker socket is not mounted inside any containers|High|
|-|Ensure containers do not allow unsafe allocation of CPU resources|Medium|
|-|Ensure containers do not allow privilege escalation|Medium|
|-|Ensure containers do not expose unsafe parts of /proc|Medium|
|-|Ensure containers are not exposed through a shared host port|Medium|
