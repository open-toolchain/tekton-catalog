**WARNING: These tasks needs to run on Kubernetes cluster with minimal version 1.16. If you are using your own Delivery Pipeline Private Worker to run your tekton pipeline(s), ensure your cluster is updated to this version at least.**

## Install the Tasks
- Add a github integration to your toolchain with the repository containing the tasks (https://github.com/open-toolchain/tekton-catalog)
- Add this github integration to the Definitions tab of your Continuous Delivery tekton pipeline, with the Path set to `devops-insights`

## Usage
The `sample` sub-directory contains an EventListener and Pipeline definition that you can include in your Tekton pipeline configuration to run an example of the differents DOI related tasks.
